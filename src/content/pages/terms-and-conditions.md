  6.1 You represent and warrant that:

  6.1.1 the Registration Details are correct; and

  6.1.2 you are the rightful owner of the money which you at any time deposit in your Account.

  6.2 To maintain a high level of security to protect your funds, you accept that we will perform random security checks and keep records of transactions and wagers. By agreeing to the Terms and Conditions you authorise us to undertake any such verification checks from time to time as we may require ourselves or may be required by third parties (including, but not limited to, regulatory bodies) to confirm these facts (the "Checks"). You agree that from time to time, upon our request, you may be required to provide additional details in respect of any of such information you have provided us, including in relation to any deposits which you have made into your Account. You accept that we may demand additional documentation in the event of a security check and that we may terminate and/or suspend your Account and/or withhold payment to you if we do not receive such documentation. In addition, we will not register you unless you provide us with the correct documentation requested of you in order to verify your identity.

  6.3 Whilst we are undertaking any Checks from time to time, we may restrict you from withdrawing funds from your Account and/or prevent access to all or certain parts of the Website. Please note that we may from time to time re-perform the Checks for regulatory, security or other business reasons.

  6.4 In certain circumstances we may have to contact you and ask you to provide further information to us directly in order to complete the Checks. For this purpose, we will be entitled, at our sole discretion, to require that you provide us with a notarised ID or any equivalent certified ID according to the applicable law of your jurisdiction or otherwise, proof of address, utility bills, bank details, bank statements and bank references. Until such information has been supplied to our satisfaction we may prevent any activity to be undertaken by you in relation to the Account or we may, where we reasonably believe that deliberately incorrect information has been provided by you, keep any amount deposited on the Account following the closure of the Account by us.

  6.5 If we are unable to confirm that you are 18 years of age or over then we may suspend your Account until such time that we are able to confirm that you are the 18 years of age or over. If you are subsequently proven to have been under the age of 18 at the time you made any transactions with us, then:

  6.5.1 your Account will be closed;

  6.5.2 all transactions made whilst you were underage will be made void, and all related funds deposited by you will be returned by the payment method used for the deposit of such funds, wherever practicable; and

7. DEPOSIT AND WITHDRAWALS

  7.1 You must have registered an Account with us and deposited a minimum of £10 in order to play the Games on our Service. You can then wager up to the amount available in your Account. You can play demonstration versions of each Game without registering or logging in.

  7.2 In certain circumstances (for example no deposit bonuses) it may be possible to play the Games without the minimum deposit.

  7.3 You can make deposits into your Account by accessing the 'deposits' option in the Account section. You can only have one active card number with your Account and no card can be registered to more than one account. You can only use your card to make deposits in the Account with which it has been registered. For the avoidance of doubt ‘your card’ means a card that you are the account holder of. A card is considered ‘active’ when it is the current/ last payment method used. The ‘active card’ cannot be changed whilst there is a balance of £10 or greater on your Account. This is to comply with our anti money laundering obligations.

  7.4 When using our services, you will send money to and may receive money from us. We may use third party payment service providers (PSPs) to process deposits and withdrawals from your account. You authorise us to use PSPs, as necessary to process transactions.

  7.5.1 Minimum £10 up to a maximum of £5,000 per deposit in any 24 hour period.

  7.5.2 The maximum amount you can deposit per 24 hour period is £25,000.

  7.5.3 IPS reserve the right to increase or decrease the standard site deposit limits for individual players at their discretion.

  7.6 In the event that there is a chargeback for whatever reason you accept and acknowledge that we will be able to suspend your Account indefinitely to enable us to investigate and resolve the matter. During such period any monies due or requested will be withheld.

  7.7 The balance held in your Account will not earn interest in your favour.

  7.8 You must maintain your Account in order to place wagers in any of the Games. We reserve the right to refuse or limit any wager(s) for any reason, and in any event you are not allowed to place a wager greater than the amount in credit in your Account (after taking into account all previous wagers).

  7.9 Subject to the provisions of these terms, you can make withdrawals from your Account up to your current available balance by wire transfer back to credit or debit card (subject to the conditions set out below and after taking into account all previous wagers). There are minimum and maximum limits on the amounts that you can withdraw from your Account. You may only make a maximum of 5 withdrawals from your Account in any one 24 hour period. Please note the following conditions:

  7.9.1 Withdrawal by wire transfer is only available for a United Kingdom bank account: each withdrawal must be at least £20 (save in the case of a final withdrawal to close an account) and no greater than £10,000 in any 24-hour period. A transfer will only be made to an account in your name and such account must not be at a branch located in any of the jurisdictions referred to at 3.1(a) above. Wire transfers in excess of £1,000 will require proof of identity to be provided.

Withdrawals in excess of £1,000 will require proof of identity to be provided.

  7.9.4 We do NOT offer withdrawal by cheque.

  7.9.5 IPS reserve the right to increase or decrease the standard site withdrawal limits for individual players at their discretion.

  7.10 We also reserve the right to pay individual withdrawal requests over £10,000 in monthly installments of £10,000, e.g.: should you make a withdrawal request of £20,000, we reserve the right to fulfil that request/s in monthly instalments of £10,000.

  7.11 If you wish to withdraw less than the minimum amount this can only be done as part of the account closure process.

  7.12 Subject to the provisions of these terms, when you close your Account you will be entitled to the return of all funds in it.

  7.13 If, as part of a promotional campaign or competition, we credit an amount to an account registered in your name, you can only use such amounts as wagers for playing the Games.

  7.15 In the normal course of play, players will not be charged to deposit or withdraw funds. However in the event of any suspected misuse of the deposit and withdrawal functionality, IP&S Ltd reserve the absolute right to charge players a handling fee reflecting the costs of any financial transaction charges incurred as a result of an individual player’s misuse of the financial functionality.

  7.16 If you do not use your Account for betting or gaming, making a deposit, withdrawal or transfer, or if it is otherwise inactive, for a period of at least [thirteen (13)] consecutive months then it will be an "Inactive Account". All Inactive Accounts will incur a monthly fee of [5% of your remaining account balance or £5, whichever is the greater amount] ("Inactive Account Fee"). We will notify you when your Account becomes an Inactive Account, and at least 14 days before the first Inactive Account Fee is deducted from it.

  7.17 We are required by our licence to inform customers about what happens to funds which we hold on account for you, and the extent to which funds are protected in the event of insolvency. Customers' real money balances are retained in a segregated bank account distinct from those bank accounts utilized by the Company to operate its business. These funds are not protected in the case of insolvency. This meets the UK Gambling Commission's requirements for the segregation of customer funds at the level: basic segregation. Further details can be found at http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/Consumers/Protection-of-customer-funds.aspx.

9. RESPONSIBLE GAMBLING

  9.1 You can limit the amount you can deposit to your Account by clicking on the deposit limits link which is on the homepage and the deposit page or contacting Customer Support. This limit will only apply to your Account on the Website, if you have accounts on other IPS operated sites you must set your preferred limit by account by site.

  9.2 Self exclusion: If you wish to restrict your gambling, we provide a voluntary self exclusion policy. You may instruct us to exclude you from participation in the Games by contacting Customer Support. You can also do this via the Responsible Gaming section of the My Account section when logged in. Use of this opt-out facility will result in your Account being blocked and IP&S Limited will not accept wagers from this account, or any other linked account operated by IP&S, after confirmation that your request has been received. Self exclusion is for a minimum period of 6 months. To reactivate your Account, which is only possible after the period of Self exclusion has expired we will require confirmation from you over the telephone. All requests for reactivation after Self exclusion will be given a 24 hour “cooling off” period before accounts can be re activated. This period commences following confirmation that your “cooling off” period has started. Self Exclusion will be applied to all accounts you hold on sites operated by IP&S and we encourage players to extend their self exclusion to any gambling accounts you may hold with other operators. You will be unable to open any new accounts on sites operated by IP&S. If you attempt to circumvent our account linking process we reserve the right to retain all stakes and losses made by you.

  9.5 Whilst your Account is timed out, we will endeavour to not send you any marketing material or promotional offers but this can take 48 hours to come into effect.

  9.6 To set a time out on your Account, please select a period within the ‘Responsible Gambling’ section of the ‘My Account’ pages.

  17.1 We may award bonuses to players upon successful registration and/ or at any point during your continued use of your Account. Bonuses are open to residents of Great Britain aged 18 or over, who register to full member status. Please read the terms and conditions of any bonus promotion carefully and make sure that you fully understand their contents. By participating in a bonus, you agree to be bound by the relevant bonus terms and conditions ("Bonus Terms"). All bonuses are optional, players can opt not to participate at the point of claim.

  17.2 Please be aware that Bonus Terms will ordinarily contain important wagering requirements which require you to stake a minimum number of wagers before any bonus and any winnings derived therefrom may be withdrawn ("Wagering Requirements"). Wagering Requirements for each bonus will always be communicated as a multiple of either (i) the deposit; (ii) the bonus; or (iii) both.

  17.3 A bonus with wagering requirements will only be given to players who have agreed to receive the bonus and accept the relevant Bonus Terms. Only one bonus can be active at any one time unless we state otherwise.

  17.4 Your Account will have a bonus balance containing bonus money (if any) that is kept separate from your cash balance (your "Bonus Balance" and "Cash Balance", respectively). Your Bonus Balance may never be withdrawn. When you have an active bonus, all winnings will be added to your Bonus Balance. Once the relevant Wagering Requirements have been met, the amount in the Bonus Balance linked to an active bonus will be transferred to your Cash Balance which is then available for withdrawal.

  17.5 If you deposit funds into your Account, this will show in your Cash Balance. When you have an active bonus, any attempt to withdraw funds in your Account, including any Cash Balance which is not attached to a bonus, prior to having met the full Wagering Requirements, will result in you forfeiting the bonus, and any other bonuses that may be pending in your Account at the time, including any winnings which may have been derived therefrom.

  17.6 We reserve the right to limit maximum withdrawals for non-depositing recipients of bonuses. This also applies to non depositors who make a deposit following a win from their bonus funds. For these players the maximum withdrawal will still apply. Withdrawal limits are specified per promotion and for welcome offers are listed here [https://www.ukcasino.com/promotional-terms](https://www.ukcasino.com/promotional-terms).

  17.7 Any bonus issued is valid for a period of 30 days from the date of issue unless otherwise stated in the specific promotion. Any remaining/unused bonus at the end of the stated period will be removed from the player’s Account.

  17.8 We reserve the right to modify, alter, discontinue or terminate a bonus or promotion at any time for any reason whatsoever, without notice to players. However, we will use reasonable efforts to provide advance notice to the players of any such modification, alteration, discontinuance or termination.

The value of the cash deposit will remain on the account but bonus balances will be forfeited. There is a maximum stake of £5 per bet until the playthrough requirement has been met.
